I took a Vipassana retreat in my first year out of college. It was my first exposure to Theravada Buddhism, and it emphasized breath meditation and body scans for 10 days. At the end, they got you in a room and very pointedly reminded you of the value of giving. Apparently, this is the opposite of how Buddhism is taught in Thailand. There, your first exposure to Buddhism comes when you give alms to the monks. Only after developing generosity and virtue, and experiencing the benefits of those practices, do you come to meditation. 

Generosity, virtue, and goodwill meditation are forms of [merit making](https://www.dhammatalks.org/books/Merit/Section0003.html). In the West, this component of the Dhamma doesn't get much attention, but it's foundational. Without a strong foundation in the basics, more advanced practices are unstable.

One of the Buddha's recommendations is to find people who are consummate in generosity, and then emulate them. Adam Grant is someone who seems to know generosity, and he wrote a book about it, Give and Take.

Success depends on how you treat other people. Grant classifies strategies for dealing with others into three groups: giving, matching, and taking. You might think that takers come out on top, but Grant's research shows in myriad cases that givers are actually the most effective group. However, givers are also found at the bottom of the pile, so there's a skill to giving.

Part of the difference can be explained by considering the long term. Giving often seems like a bad idea in the short term, but when you look further into the future, it pays dividends. One example is medical students; givers in their first year received the lowest grades, but in every year after that, they were the highest-performing group. Another example is of Hornik, a venture capitalist. Venture capitalism is usually cutthroat, but Hornik gives his advice to companies freely, even if he isn't invested in them. In the short term, it appears that Hornik doesn't capture the value of his expertise, but the companies he advises often return to him in the long run, so his strategy pays off. Yet another example is Lincoln, who, early in his career, sacrificed his votes to an opponent, Trumbull, to prevent a corrupt politician from winning the election. He gained the goodwill of Trumbull, who later went to bat for him so that Lincoln could become president. 

A few more ideas from the book:

Your success depends on who you work with. The famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright relied on his apprentices. Without them, he was unproductive for years. Only when he established an institution to allow students to work with him did he complete his most important work, Falling Water. Similarly, a study of high-performing financiers showed that when they switched firms, they performed significantly worse. However, those who switched with the rest of their team were able to maintain their success. 

Givers are less prone to ego threat. They care about the team, not how they will be perceived, so they are more willing to cut bad investments early on, rather than stick with them when they perform poorly.

Givers also have more grit. When you're motivated by the desire to help others, you dig deeper. The book Deep Survival corroborates this. People lost in the wilderness who care about someone back home are most likely to survive. Jocko Willinick of the Navy SEALs says the same thing: the guy who succeeds in training isn't the athlete in high school, the tough guy with tattoos; it's the guy who looks over at his buddy and gives him a hand or a word of encouragement. A concrete study in Give and Take backs this up even more: people tested on a willpower activity lasted longer when they scored high on a test for giver tendencies.

Givers see and nurture the potential in others. When others feel this confidence, it drives them to succeed. Givers are also more attuned to important attributes: they care about grit and work ethic, character and integrity, before considering raw talent.

GIvers can be utterly selfless or "otherish," considerate of their own well-being and that of others. Selfless givers don't perform very well, and aren't particularly happy, while otherish givers do well and give in ways that maximize happiness.

Giver mentality is more than the habitual act of giving. There is a network of attitudes, indicators, and effects that are involved. For example, the way someone talks, using I, you or we more, can be an indicator of whether their attitude is more taker or "otherish." Using this lens helps when I'm writing a script to deal with a conflictâ€“if the script is littered with "I" language, it's an indicator that I can pause and potentially improve. What happens to my attitude when I try to increase the amount of "we" language? This, of course, has to be done in good faith: I'm trying to change my actual attitude, not just how I present myself. I'm averse to conflict, but when I frame things with "we" language, I start to think in terms of building a long-term relationship in which both parties support one another. This frames the conflict as an opportunity to grow.

Give and Take makes a good case for altruistic values. It shows that you can be a "good" person and get ahead, and it also gives lots of examples of people doing just that. It's inspirational to read those examples, and doing so can change your sense of what is worth accomplishing.
